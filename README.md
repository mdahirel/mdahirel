### Hello 👋

I'm Maxime Dahirel (he/they)!

I am a quantitative ecologist, with expertise in:  
- **behavioural ecology**, especially animal movement and dispersal
- **urban ecology and evolution** and biodiversity in cities more generally

I work using a mix of (in no particular order) lab experiments, field surveys, data science tools and the occasional simulation.

I have mostly been working with land snails 🐌, but I've been involved in projects studying spiders 🕸️🕷️, mites, insects 🪰, plants 🍀...

Until recently I was a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at Ghent University, in the Terrestrial Ecology unit (https://www.ecology.ugent.be/terec/).

You can find more information about my research (including a more or less up-to-date CV) at https://mdahirel.github.io/
