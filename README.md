### Hello 👋

I'm Maxime Dahirel (he/they)!

I am an evolutionary ecologist, interested in:  
- 🗺️ *animal dispersal*, i.e. animals moving to reproduce away from their birth or previous reproduction sites: How, which individuals, why?  
- 🏙️ *urban ecology and evolution*: How organisms manage to persist in cities (or not)? How much do they have to change to do so? Can we predict it? What is the role of urban history and planning?

I use lab experiments, field surveys, data science tools and the occasional simulation to answer these questions.

I generally study land snails 🐌, but I've been involved in projects studying spiders 🕸️🕷️, mites, insects 🪰, plants 🍀... and snail parasites.

Until recently I was a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at Ghent University, in the Terrestrial Ecology unit (https://www.ecology.ugent.be/terec/), and I am currently looking for a job.

You can (for now!) find me on twitter [`@mdahirel`](https://twitter.com/mdahirel), and more information about my research (including a more or less up-to-date CV) at https://mdahirel.github.io/
